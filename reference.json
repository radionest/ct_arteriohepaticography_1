The frequency, appearance, and location of focal (within a subsegment) and diffuse (affecting more than one subsegment) nontumorous perfusion defects were determined. Findings on helical CTAP images were correlated with surgical findings (53 patients), results of MR examinations (25 patients), and follow-up CT examinations (11 patients).Ninety-seven nontumorous perfusion defects were identified in 68 patients. The most frequent defects were located adjacent to the gallbladder fossa (35), anterior to the porta hepatis (34), in the subcapsular portion of the liver (13), and adjacent to the falciform ligament (12). Nontumorous perfusion defects characteristically appeared wedge-shaped or flat and ranged in size from 8-20 mm.Nontumorous perfusion abnormalities have characteristic appearances and locations on helical CTAP examinations and are more common than previously reported with conventional CTAP. Familiarity with the locations and characteristic appearances of these defects is essential to prevent false-positive diagnoses, so that operative candidates are not mistakenly denied surgical therapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Bluemke","given":"D A"},{"family":"Soyer","given":"P"},{"family":"Fishman","given":"E K"}],"citation-key":"bluemkeNontumorousLowattenuationDefects1995","container-title":"American Journal of Roentgenology","DOI":"10.2214/ajr.164.5.7717221","ISSN":"0361-803X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",5]]},"page":"1141-1145","publisher":"American Roentgen Ray Society","source":"ajronline.org (Atypon)","title":"Nontumorous low-attenuation defects in the liver on helical CT during arterial portography: frequency, location, and appearance.","title-short":"Nontumorous low-attenuation defects in the liver on helical CT during arterial portography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ajronline.org/doi/10.2214/ajr.164.5.7717221","volume":"164"},

The purpose of this article is to evaluate the enhanced rim on the portal venous phase (PVP) on MDCT as a predictor of 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) and response to bevacizumab-based chemotherapy in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM).MATERIALS AND METHODS. We retrospectively identified 111 patients with primary unresectable CRLM treated with bevacizumab-based chemotherapy at two institutions between 2012 and 2018. Pretreatment contrast-enhanced MDCT images were reviewed and data on clinical characteristics were collected from the electronic medical records. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted to assess several imaging features and clinical characteristics as potential predictors of 1-year PFS and objective response rate (ORR).RESULTS. After 1 year of follow-up, liver metastatic tumor progression was detected in 52 patients (46.8%) after bevacizumab-based chemotherapy. A log-rank test showed that enhanced rim on PVP (chi-square test, 5.862; p = 0.015) and the occurrence of liver resection surgery (chi-square test, 7.836; p = 0.005) were significant predictors of 1-year PFS. Multivariable analysis showed that enhanced rim on PVP images was an independent predictor of 1-year PFS (hazard ratio, 0.510; 95% CI, 0.282–0.926; p = 0.027) and ORR (odds ratio, 4.694; p < 0.001).CONCLUSION. The presence of an enhanced rim on PVP MDCT is an independent predictor of survival and response to bevacizumab-based chemotherapy among patients with CRLM.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheng","given":"Jin"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Meng"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yinli"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Nan"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Danhua"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yi"}],"citation-key":"chengEnhancedRimMDCT2020","container-title":"American Journal of Roentgenology","DOI":"10.2214/AJR.19.22280","ISSN":"0361-803X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"page":"1377-1383","publisher":"American Roentgen Ray Society","source":"ajronline.org (Atypon)","title":"Enhanced Rim on MDCT of Colorectal Liver Metastases: Assessment of Ability to Predict Progression-Free Survival and Response to Bevacizumab-Based Chemotherapy","title-short":"Enhanced Rim on MDCT of Colorectal Liver Metastases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ajronline.org/doi/10.2214/AJR.19.22280","volume":"215"},

MATERIALS AND  METHODS: Fifteen patients with either hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n = 8) or  hypervascular liver metastases from uveal melanoma (n = 7) underwent arterial and  portal venous C-arm CT of the liver using intraarterial contrast media  administration directly before TACE. The number and location of their hepatic  malignancies were compared with those on MDCT. The scan coverage was documented  and the liver diameter measured on MDCT. RESULTS: Compared with MDCT, the  sensitivity and specificity for segmental tumor involvement were 97% (76/78) and  85% (28/33), respectively, for reader 1, and 99% (77/78) and 79% (24/29),  respectively, for reader 2.

  {"id":"ozakiLiverMetastasesCorrelation2022","abstract":"A wide range of imaging manifestations of liver metastases can be encountered, as various primary cancers preferably metastasize to the liver (organ-specific metastases), with the imaging characteristics largely depending on various primary tumor–specific factors such as histopathologic category, degree of tumor differentiation, histologic behavior, and intratumor alterations. Characteristic imaging features potentially can help provide a more precise diagnosis in some clinical settings. These settings include those of (a) primary cancers of hollow organs such as gastrointestinal organs, the lungs, and the bladder, owing to the appearance of metastases that cannot be applied to the liver, which is a parenchymal organ; (b) unknown primary tumors; (c) more than one primary tumor; (d) another emergent malignancy; and (e) transformation to a different histopathologic tumor subtype. The characteristic features include the target sign on T2-weighted MR images or during the hepatobiliary phase of hypovascular metastasis, the peripheral rim washout sign on delayed phase images, peritumor hyperintensity during the hepatobiliary phase, hypervascular metastasis, a cystic appearance with marked hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, marked hyperintensity on T1-weighted images, calcification, capsular retraction, absence of the vessel-penetrating sign, distribution of liver metastases, and rare intraductal forms of metastases. In addition to various factors associated with the primary cancer, desmoplastic reactions around the tumor—which can be observed in adenocarcinomas with peripheral and peritumor enhancement, distinct arterioportal shunts with metastases from pancreatic ductal carcinoma, and pseudocirrhosis—also can affect these findings. The authors review the characteristic imaging findings of liver metastases from various primary cancers, with a focus on the mechanisms that underlie organ-specific liver metastases.

MATERIALS  AND METHODS: Between March 2014 and December 2016, 49 consecutive patients  referred for intra-arterial treatment for colorectal cancer liver metastases were  enrolled in a single-center observational study. All patients were examined with  MDCT and with dual-phase C-arm cone beam computed tomography performed after  iodine injection in the proper hepatic artery before intra-arterial treatment.  Two blinded observers independently reviewed all examinations. Diagnostic  accuracy was determined using both a six-cell matrix method and a \"worst-case  scenario.\" RESULTS: Readers identified at MDCT 264 colorectal liver metastases  and 43 other liver lesions. The early and late arterial phase showed 240 and 277  liver lesions respectively. A certainty of the diagnosis was obtained in 63% and  85% at the early (EAP) and late arterial phase (LAP), respectively. Streak  artifacts or liver segment truncation, or inadequate enhancement was responsible  for the inability to see or to correctly adjudicate a lesion to a diagnosis in  27% and 15% of the cases at the EAP and LAP. The \"worst-case scenario\" yielded a  Se and Sp of 58% and 51%, respectively, at EAP and 84% and 70%, respectively, at  LAP. CONCLUSION: On CBCT, EAP showed limited accuracy. LAP provided the best  tumor detectability. KEY POINTS: • The early arterial phase (EAP) yielded poor  accuracy: Se = 58% and Sp = 51% (p < 0.0001). • The late arterial phase (LAP)  phase yielded good accuracy: Se = 84% and Se = 70% (p = 0.02). • The probability  of a correct diagnosis at the EAP was 60%.","author":[{"family":"Pellerin","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Pereira","given":"Helena"},{"family":"Van Ngoc Ty","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Moussa","given":"Nadia"},{"family":"Del Giudice","given":"Costantino"},{"family":"Pernot","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Déan","given":"Carole"},{"family":"Chatellier","given":"Gilles"},{"family":"Sapoval","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"pellerinDualphaseCarmCBCT2019","container-title":"European radiology","container-title-short":"Eur Radiol","DOI":"10.1007/s00330-019-06173-0","event-place":"Germany","ISSN":"1432-1084 0938-7994","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10]]},"language":"eng","page":"5253-5263","PMID":"30937583","publisher-place":"Germany","title":"Is dual-phase C-arm CBCT sufficiently accurate for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer liver metastasis during liver intra-arterial treatment?","type":"article-journal","volume":"29"},
  {"id":"puijkTranscatheterCTHepatic2020","abstract":"PURPOSE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of CT hepatic arteriography compared with conventional CT fluoroscopy guidance in percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) and  microwave (MW) ablation to treat colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). MATERIALS  AND METHODS: This single-center comparative, retrospective study analyzed data of  108 patients treated with 156 percutaneous ablation procedures (42 CT fluoroscopy  guidance [25 RF ablation, 17 MW ablation]; 114 CT hepatic arteriography guidance  [18 RF ablation, 96 MW ablation]) for 260 CRLM between January 2009 and May 2019.  Local tumor progression-free survival (LTPFS) was assessed using univariate and  multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses. LTPFS and overall  survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: There were  no complications related to the transarterial catheter procedure. CT hepatic  arteriography proved superior to CT fluoroscopy regarding 2-year LTPFS (18/202  [8.9%] vs 19/58 [32.8%]; P < .001, respectively). CT hepatic arteriography versus  CT fluoroscopy (hazard ratio = 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.54; P <  .001) and MW ablation versus RF ablation (hazard ratio = 0.52; 95% confidence  interval, 0.24-1.12; P = .094) were positive predictors for longer LTPFS.  Multivariate analysis revealed that CT hepatic arteriography versus CT  fluoroscopy (hazard ratio = 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.90; P = .025)  was associated with a significantly superior LTPFS. OS was similar between the 2  cohorts (P = .3). CONCLUSIONS: While adding procedure time and marginal patient  burden, transcatheter CT hepatic arteriography-guided ablation was associated  with increased local disease control and superior LTPFS compared with  conventional CT fluoroscopy. CT hepatic arteriography represents a safe and valid  alternative to CT fluoroscopy, as it reduces the number of repeat ablations  required without adding risk or detrimental effect on survival.","author":[{"family":"Puijk","given":"Robbert S."},{"family":"Nieuwenhuizen","given":"Sanne"},{"family":"Bemd","given":"Bente A.

METHODS: This IRB-approved, retrospective study included 28 patients with  neuroendocrine (NELM), colorectal (CRCLM), or sarcoma (SLM) liver metastases who  underwent DP-CBCT during intra-arterial therapy (IAT) between 01/2010 and  10/2014. DP-CBCT was acquired after a single contrast agent injection in the  tumor-feeding arteries at early and delayed arterial phases (EAP and DAP). The  visibility of each lesion was graded by two radiologists in consensus on a  three-rank scale (complete, partial, none) on DP-CBCT and DSA images using CE-MRI  as reference. RESULTS: 47 NELM, 43 CRCLM, and 16 SLM were included. On DSA 85.1,  44.1, and 37.5 % of NELM, CRCLM, and SLM, were at least partially depicted,  respectively. EAP-CBCT yielded significantly higher sensitivities of 88.3 and  87.5 % for CRCLM and SLM, respectively (p < 0.01), but not for NELM (89.4 %;  p = 1.0). On DAP-CBCT all NELM, CRCLM, and SLM were visible (p < 0.001). Complete  depiction was achieved on DSA for 59.6, 16.3, and 18.8 % of NELM, CRCLM, and SLM,  respectively. The complete depiction rate on EAP-CBCT was significantly higher  for CRCLM (46.5 %; p < 0.001), lower for NELM (40.4 %; p = 0.592), and similar  for SLM (25 %, p = 0.399). On DAP-CBCT however, the highest rates of complete  depiction were found-NELM (97.8 %; p = 0.008), CRCLM (95.3 %; p = 0.008), and SLM  (100 %; p < 0.001).

  {"id":"vanderleiAddedDiagnosticValue2023","abstract":"PURPOSE: This study assessed the diagnostic value of CT hepatic arteriography (CTHA) for the intraprocedural detection of previously unknown colorectal liver  metastases (CRLM) and the impact on the definitive treatment plan. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: All patients treated with CTHA-guided percutaneous ablation for CRLM  between January 2012 and March 2022 were identified from the Amsterdam Colorectal  Liver Met Registry (AmCORE). Radiology reports of the ablative procedure and  follow-up imaging were reviewed to see if (a) previously unknown CRLM were  detected intra-procedurally and if (b) new CRLM, potentially missed on CTHA,  appeared within 6 months following the procedure; three abdominal radiologists  re-reviewed the baseline CTHA scans of these patients with early recurrence. To  ratify immediate ablations of concomitantly detected CRLM, the upper limit of  false positives was predefined at 10%. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-two  patients were included. With CTHA, a total of 17 additional tumours in 15  patients were diagnosed and treated immediately, two representing disappeared  tumours following systemic chemotherapy. Compared to the conventional  contrast-enhanced (ce)CT, ceMRI and 18F-FDG PET-CT, adding CTHA was superior for  the detection of CRLM (P < .001). Within 12 months of follow-up 121, new CRLM  appeared in 49/152 patients (32.2%); retrospective blinded assessment revealed 56  to already be visible on the baseline CTHA scan (46%); four lesions without  substrate on follow-up scans were considered false positives (n = 4/60; 7%).  Arterial ring enhancement was the most frequently reported imaging characteristic  (n = 45/60; 75%). CONCLUSION: The subsequent use of CTHA has added value for the  detection of previously unknown and vanished CRLM. Taking into account the low  number of false positives (7%) and the favourable safety profile of percutaneous  ablation, we believe that immediate ablation of typical ring-enhancing  supplementary tumours is justified and sufficiently validated.

  {"id":"vantilborgTranscatheterCTArterial2014","abstract":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of combining transcatheter computed tomography (CT) arterial portography or transcatheter CT hepatic arteriography  with percutaneous liver ablation for optimized and repeated tumor exposure.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study participants were 20 patients (13 men and 7 women;  mean age, 59.4 y; range, 40-76 y) with unresectable liver-only malignancies--14  with colorectal liver metastases (29 lesions), 5 with hepatocellular carcinoma (7  lesions), and 1 with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (2 lesions)--that were  obscure on nonenhanced CT. A catheter was placed within the superior mesenteric  artery (CT arterial portography) or in the hepatic artery (CT hepatic  arteriography). CT arterial portography or CT hepatic arteriography was  repeatedly performed after injecting 30-60 mL 1:2 diluted contrast material to  plan, guide, and evaluate ablation. The operator confidence levels and the  liver-to-lesion attenuation differences were assessed as well as needle-to-target  mismatch distance, technical success, and technique effectiveness after 3 months.  RESULTS: Technical success rate was 100%; there were no major complications.  Compared with conventional unenhanced CT, operator confidence increased  significantly for CT arterial portography or CT hepatic arteriography cases (P <  .001). The liver-to-lesion attenuation differences between unenhanced CT,  contrast-enhanced CT, and CT arterial portography or CT hepatic arteriography  were statistically significant (mean attenuation difference, 5 HU vs 28 HU vs 70  HU; P < .001). Mean needle-to-target mismatch distance was 2.4 mm ± 1.2 (range,  0-12.0 mm). Primary technique effectiveness at 3 months was 87% (33 of 38  lesions).
